# Intro

I created this game engine when I needed a solid foundation for some games I wanted to include on my personal portfolio.

You can see the game engine in action [here](https://samscolari.me)

You can learn more about the creation process and my motivations for creating this game engine here

## Getting Started

Setting up a basic game is only a few lines, this creates us a simple game with a black background.

```typescript
import Game, { Scene } from "@sam-scolari/game-engine";

const canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");

const game = new Game(canvas);

const scene = new Scene();
scene.background = "black";

game.load(scene);
game.start();
```

import Game1 from "../src/example/Game1";

<Game1 />

We can then import the type of GameObject we want and set a few properties.

```typescript
import { Box } from "@sam-scolari/game-engine";

const box = new Box();
box.size = { width: 60, height: 60 };
box.position = {
  x: canvas.width / 2 - box.size.width / 2,
  y: canvas.height / 2 - box.size.height / 2,
};
box.fill = "white";

scene.add(box);
```

import Game2 from "../src/example/Game2";

<Game2 />

Now to add basic movement we can give the box a Rigidbody, define a custom onUpdate function, and apply a force based on the key that was pressed.

```typescript
box.physics = new Rigidbody(box);
box.physics.gravity = 0;

box.onUpdate = (inputs) => {
  if (inputs["a"]) {
    box.physics.addForce(5, -(Math.PI / 2));
  }

  if (inputs["d"]) {
    box.physics.addForce(5, Math.PI / 2);
  }

  if (inputs["w"]) {
    box.physics.addForce(5, 0);
  }

  if (inputs["s"]) {
    box.physics.addForce(5, Math.PI);
  }
};
```

import Game3 from "../src/example/Game3";

<Game3 />

There is one problem with this, the box will continue to move off screen where it is not visible to the player. Lets utilize a built in module to create the WarpAround effect seen in games like Asteroids. To use WarpAround first import it then call it in the box's onUpdate function.

```typescript
import { WarpAround } from "@sam-scolari/game-engine";

box.onUpdate = (inputs) => {
  WarpAround(box, canvas);

  if (inputs["a"]) {
    box.physics.addForce(5, -(Math.PI / 2));
  }

  if (inputs["d"]) {
    box.physics.addForce(5, Math.PI / 2);
  }

  if (inputs["w"]) {
    box.physics.addForce(5, 0);
  }

  if (inputs["s"]) {
    box.physics.addForce(5, Math.PI);
  }
};
```

import Game4 from "../src/example/Game4";

<Game4 />

Lets start adding some collisions to the game. We will make the objective to collect red boxes which will grow the size of the white box as it collects them and spawn a new box in a random location on the canvas.

```typescript
function createFood() {
  const food = new Box();
  food.size = { width: 20, height: 20 };
  food.position = {
    x: Math.random() * canvas.width,
    y: Math.random() * canvas.height,
  };
  food.fill = "red";

  food.onUpdate = () => {
    if (box.collidesWith(food)) {
      scene.remove(food);
      box.size.width += 10;
      box.size.height += 10;
      createFood();
    }
  };

  scene.add(food);
}

createFood();
```

import Game5 from "../src/example/Game5";

<Game5 />

And that is how you make a simple game with my game engine. Check out the rest of the docs to learn more about how it works.
